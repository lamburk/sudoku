# sudoku-solver

Write a constraint satisfaction problem solver to solve sudoku puzzles of varying size (see the link for the rules if you're unfamiliar with sudoku puzzles). The goal is to obtain a performance comparison of various CSP strategies.
The input to the solver is a Sudoku board, and the output should be a complete solution, along with the number of consistency checks utilized (for this project, this is equal to the number of variable assignments your code makes).

There are three files given in test folder, from which, you need to check your code.
